### Checkers
Checkers in C++ with a graphical interface created using SFML.

# How to run?
To run the game, you need to have SFML 2.5.1 included in your Visual Studio. Then, open the "checkers.sln" project in Visual Studio and press the "Run without debugging" button or use the shortcut Ctrl+F5. This is the easiest (tested) way to compile and play the game.
